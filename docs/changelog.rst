0.2.1 (2018-Dec-29)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Adding missing methods to ``SubscribeView`` and ``Manager`` to record
  payment transactions. Added additional method
  (``retrieve_transaction_date``) to help with transaction date
  specification. Reworked method calls around payment processing to
  streamline passing of arguments between functions to reduce need to
  override methods.
* Fixing issue in ``Manager`` class where the future billing date was
  based off the current datetime, rather than the last billed datetime.
* Adding method to update next billing datetimes for due subscriptions
  in the ``Manager`` class.
* Switching the default ``success_url`` for ``SubscribeView`` and
  ``CancelView`` to the user-specific list of their subscriptions,
  rather than the subscription CRUD dashboard.

Feature Updates
---------------
* Switching arguments for the ``process_payment`` call to keyword
  arguments (``kwargs``).

* Passing the PlanCostForm form into the process_payment call to
  allow access to the amount to bill.
