"""Classes and functions to manage user subscriptions."""
# Will need functions to:
#   Adding subscriptions to users
#   Process billing
#   Updating UserSubscription dates and status codes

# Thoughts: create this as a class to allow easy extending?
# e.g. handling payment processing
# The task manager can be directed to the object which handles everything
# which allows easy overriding to customize functionality
